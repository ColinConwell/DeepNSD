In this sub-directory, you will find the [source data](source_data/) and [analysis code](all_results.R) for *directly* (numerically) reproducing the results and figures in the Nature Communications article ["What can 1.8 billion regressions tell us about the pressures shaping high-level visual representation in brains and machines?"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53147-y)


To regenerate the source data (following our original methods as closely as possible), see [source_code/pressures](../source_code) in the root of this repo. To install the necessary packages to reproduce the numerical results, see [environment](environment/README.md).
