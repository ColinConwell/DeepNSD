Reproducing "What can 1.8 billion regressions tell us about the pressures shaping high-level visual representation in brains and machines?"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.28.485868v1.abstract)

In this sub-repository, you will find the [source data](source_data/) and [analysis code](all_results.R) for *directly* (numerically) reproducing results and figures in the manuscript "What can 1.8 billion regressions tell us about the pressures shaping high-level visual representation in brains and machines?" by Colin Conwell, Jacob S. Prince, Kendrick N. Kay, George A. Alvarez, and Talia Konkle, currently in press at Nature Communications.

To regenerate the source data (following our original methods as closely as possible), see [source_code/pressures](../source_code) in the root of this repo. To install the necessary packages to reproduce the numerical results, see [environment](environment/README.md).
