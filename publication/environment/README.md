# Setup + Installation to Reproduce Results

## Publication Results

The results (statistics, figures, tables) in the publication were computed in R. Package versions at the time of submission are listed in [R-Packages](R-Packages.csv). Running the code in the forematter of ['all_results.csv'](all_results.R) should load these packages.
